### HTML Implementations

I'm using HTML structures from Grace Snow's Product Preview Page [^1].
And these are the details of the HTML implementations:

#### 游댯 Embed `svg` directly into HTML

Embed the `svg` code directly into HTML, to adjust the `svg` `fill` color based on the button variants [^2].

The code below has `btn--primary` class. The class makes the button's color `green` and the `svg` `fill` =`white`. If the `btn--primary` is removed, the button's color becomes `cream` and `svg` `fill` becomes `black`.

This implementation is actually not necessary, but I just to make some test.

```html
<button class="btn btn--primary">
  <svg
    aria-hidden="true"
    width="15"
    height="16"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    <path ... />
  </svg>
  <span>Add to Cart</span>
</button>
```

Also hide the `svg` with `aria-hidden = "true"` as it is a presentational icon [^3].

#### 游댯 Applying responsive image using `<picture>`

Utilize `<picture>` element to put different images on mobile and tablet layout. The mobile layout has the cropped version of the image [^5].

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 48rem)"
  />
  <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Elegant parfume box" />
</picture>
```

### Sass Implementations

If you don't know about Sass, it is a stylesheet programming language made specific for CSS. It can do a lot more than normal CSS. More operations on variables, nesting selectors, creating functions, etc. Read more [introduction to Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/).

The implementation of Sass in the project:

#### 游릭 Setup Sass project

1. Sass is installed in the project using NPM, so you need to [install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) first if you haven't done so.

2. In the root project folder, execute `npm init` to create Node configuration file (read more [beginner guide to using NPM](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm)). This will create _package.json_ file in the root folder.

3. Then add these list of packages to the project using NPM (Install it as dev dependencies using `npm install --save-dev [package-name]`):

   - **sass**: Sass package.
   - [**browser-sync**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync): To serve the html in your local machine, similar to [Live Server VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
   - [**cpx2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpx2): To copy html and image files.
   - **npm-run-all**: Execute NPM script in parallel.
   - [**postcss-cli**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cli): Process CSS after build process.
   - **autoprefixer**: Automatically add browser prefixes to CSS properties (_postcss_ plugin).
   - **cssnano**: Compress CSS (_postcss_ plugin).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can install them one by one, or install them all at once by listing all the package names separated by spaces. Example: `npm install --save-dev package1 package2 package3`.

   Once installed, there will be this list of packages in the _package.json_ file.

   ```json
   ...
   "devDependencies": {
     "autoprefixer": "^10.4.21",
     "browser-sync": "^3.0.3",
     "cpx2": "^8.0.0",
     "cssnano": "^7.0.6",
     "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
     "postcss-cli": "^11.0.1",
     "sass": "^1.85.1"
   }
   ```

4. Add these _NPM scripts_ code in the _package.json_ file:

   ```json
   ...
   "scripts": {
     "watch:sass": "sass --watch src/scss:src --source-map-urls=relative",
     "build:sass": "sass src/scss:public --no-source-map",
     "copy": "cpx \"src/**/*.{html,jpg,png,svg}\" public",
     "serve": "browser-sync start --server src --files src",
     "postbuild": "postcss public/*.css -u autoprefixer cssnano -r --no-map",
     "start": "npm-run-all --parallel watch:* serve",
     "build": "npm-run-all build:* copy"
   },
   ...
   ```

   There are two main scripts that you can run:

   - `start` (run using `npm run start` or just `npm start`), and
   - `build` (run using `npm run build` ).

   > [!TIP]
   > As an alternative to typing the command manually in the command prompt, in VSCode you can show the _NPM Scripts_ panel inside the _Explorer_ panel by clicking the _three dots menu_ in the _Explorer_ title and check the _NPM Script_. Once the _NPM Scripts_ panel is shown you can just click the `run` button to run the script.

   These are the breakdown of the scripts. The other 5 scripts are executed in the 2 main scripts.

   - `"start": "npm-run-all --parallel watch:* serve"`

     This is used when developing the project. It executes the other 2 scripts in parallel:

     - `"watch:sass": "sass --watch src/sass:src --source-map-urls=relative"`

       Compile the `*.scss` files in the _src/scss_ directory to _src/style.css_. Also auto compile it if there are changes to any of the `*.scss` files.

     - `"serve": "browser-sync start --server src --files src"`

       Launch a local development server, for example: `http://localhost:3000/`.

     With these 2 scripts, when you make changes in the html or scss files and save it, the changes will be shown immediately on the browser.

   - `"build": "npm-run-all build:* copy"`

     It compiles the files for deployment on the remote server. This script produces files in _/public/_ folder.

     It executes the other 3 scripts:

     - `"build:sass": "sass src/sass:public --no-source-map"`

       Compile the `*.scss` file at once, no need to watch the changes. Output the CSS in the public folder.

     - `"copy": "cpx \"src/\*_/_.{html,jpg,png,svg}\" public"`

       Copy all the `*.html` and the image files from the _/src/_ to the _/public/_ folder.

     - `"postbuild": "postcss public/*.css -u autoprefixer cssnano -r --no-map"`

       This script is run automatically after running the _build_ script. It adds browser prefixes to the CSS and then compress the CSS for better performance when downloaded.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Even if I have the build script, I don't use it. I don't use the files in the _public_ folder and put in the server, but instead I use the files in the _src_ folder. The reason is to allow anyone to debug the Sass code.

#### 游릭 Sass folder and file structure

The Sass files are located in _/src/sass/_ folder.

It consists of:

- `style.scss`.
- Sass partial files (prefixed with an underscore "\_"). Example: `_base.scss`.

  The partial files are put inside multiple folders. The folder structure is using the 7-1 pattern [^4]. There are 7 folders of which each has one or more than one Sass partial files inside. All these partial files are imported in the `style.scss`.

Each of the partial files has underscore "\_" as its prefix and is skipped by the Sass compiler. Only one file is compiled: `style.scss` to `style.css`.

```YAML
- public/
- src/
- sass/
  - base/
  - components/
  - layout/
  - pages/
  - themes/
  - abstracts/
  - vendors/
  - style.scss
- index.html
```

#### 游릭 Implementing `rem` using Sass _function_

In the previous challenge I use [CSS variables to store `rem` unit](https://github.com/finkusuma-dev/fem-recipe-page/?tab=readme-ov-file#-css-variables-for-px-and-rem), in this challenge with Sass I created a functon to convert `px` to `rem`.

```scss
@function rem($value) {
  @return if(math.unit($value) == 'px', calc($value / 16px * 1rem), $value);
}
```

Using function is so much more convenient as you can just use the function in an assignment and pass the value in pixel.

```scss
.attribution {
  font-size: rem(11px);
}
```

Or also can pass in a variable.

```scss
.product-preview-card {
  border-radius: rem($spacing-100);
}
```

This function implements a false case where, if the value is not in pixels, it returns the original value without any conversion. This prevents unwanted results when we accidentally pass a variable with units other than pixels.

#### 游릭 Implementing responsive layout media queries using _Mixin_

With Sass it's easier to write media query. Using _Mixin_, it enables to re-use styles to any part of the code.

I put all the code related with the responsive layout in the `_responsive_layouts.scss` partial.

```scss
// _responsive_layouts.scss

$breakpoints: (
  $medium: functions.rem(768px),
  $xxl: functions.rem(1440px),
);

@mixin media-up-to($breakpoint) {
  ...
}
```

To use the _mixin_, call it with `@include` followed by the _mixin_ name. This is an example of adding a tablet layout to the `body` element.

```scss
body {
  @include media-up-to($medium) {
    min-height: 100vh;

    /* To center .container */
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

The compiled CSS result:

```css
@media (min-width: 48rem) {
  body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    /* To center .container */
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

#### 游릭 Implementing text presets using _Mixin_

The text presets specified in the design includes CSS properties such as `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing`. All of those can be accepted by a single CSS property: `font`, except the `letter-spacing`. This makes assigning the text presets must apply the `font` and `letter-spacing` individually.

```scss
// abstracts/_variables.scss
$text-preset-4: 500 functions.rem(12px) #{'/'} 1.2 $font-montserrat, sans-serif;

// components/_ribbon_text.scss
.ribbon-text {
  font: $text-preset-4; // Apply font-family, font-size, font-weight, and line-height
  letter-spacing: 5px; // Apply letter-spacing
}
```

To make assigning the text presets more effectively, I created variables to hold a [Sass map](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps/) containing `font` and `letter-spacing`.

```scss
// abstracts/_text_presets.scss
$text-preset-4: (
  'font': (
    500 functions.rem(12px) #{'/'} 1.2 $font-montserrat,
    sans-serif,
  ),
  'letter-spacing': 5px,
);
```

And then created a _mixin_ to map values to their corresponding CSS properties.

```scss
// abstracts/_text_presets.scss

@mixin apply-text-preset($preset) {
  font: map.get($preset, 'font');
  letter-spacing: map.get($preset, 'letter-spacing');
}
```

This is the example of how to apply the `text-preset-4` to `ribbon-text` class:

```scss
// components/_ribbon_text.scss
.ribbon-text {
  @include apply-text-preset($text-preset-4);
}
```
